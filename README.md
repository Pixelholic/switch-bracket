 Brackets for reducing travel in mechanical fret modded Clone Hero controllers.

This is to replace the usage of ball bearings inside of the mechanical switches (Kailh Choc) used for frets, as inconsistencies and overtapping occur using that method.

There's 2 types, depending on what frets you're working with. The 12mm and 15mm version correspond to the fret height, not the height of the bracket. 

Use whichever works. You can also resize the brackets in Cura or anything similar to suit your guitar, though they both should work with just about any guitar from any console. 

If you notice any problems with your specific guitar, submit a pull request with your guitar type and what console its for, the height of your frets, and what bracket you used.
